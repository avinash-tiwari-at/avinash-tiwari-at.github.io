    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in a small village called Baidaura in the Shravasti district of Uttar Pradesh. I have done my early schooling at Jagat Jeet Inter College, a college in my hometown, Ikauna. After that, I moved to Allahabad (now Prayagraj) for further studies and did my undergraduate in Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Then I joined the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati for my masters in Physics. Currently, I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune.
