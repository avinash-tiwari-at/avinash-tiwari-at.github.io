    <h3>Welcome to My Home Page</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. student at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, where I work with Prof. <a href="https://shasvath-kapadia.github.io/home/" target="_blank">Shasvath J. Kapadia</a>. I work on several aspects of Gravitational waves emanating from compact binary coalescences (CBCs), ranging from the waveform construction of the Waltzing binaries to determining their formation channel and profiling the environments that nurture them. Apart from these, I also work on different aspects of the eccentricity of the CBCs, studying the properties of a population of CBCs, and Cosmology. For more details about my work, see the <a href="https://avinash-tiwari-at.github.io/research.html" target="_blank">Research</a>.
