    <h3>Welcome to My Home Page</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. student at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, where I work with Prof. [Shasvath J. Kapadia](https://shasvath-kapadia.github.io/home/). I work on several aspects of Gravitational waves emanating from compact binary coalescences (CBCs), ranging from the waveform construction of the Waltzing binaries to determining their formation channel and profiling the environments that nurture them.
