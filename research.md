      I primarily work on Gravitational waves emanating from compact binary coalescences (CBCs), ranging from waveform construction of the Waltzing binaries, by studying the kinematics of the center of mass of these binaries and the distortions they cause in the GW waveform, to determining their formation channels and profiling the environments that nurture them. The idea is based on the fact that a time-varying Doppler shift of the CBC's centre-of-mass (CoM) will modulate the phase of GW waveforms it emits with respect to the one produced by an isolated CBC. Since the environments hosting these binaries have characteristic properties such as mass and potential profiles that govern the kinematics of the center of masses of these binaries, they imprint themselves on the emanated GWs (see Figure 1). Therefore, by studying the kinematics of the CoM of the CBC, one can profile the environment and also determine its formation channel at the level of an individual binary.
